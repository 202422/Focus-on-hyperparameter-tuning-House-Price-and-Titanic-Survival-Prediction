# House-Price-Prediction-and-Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Focus-on-Hyperparameter-Tuning
This work covers the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to training, evaluation, and making predictions, using both classification and regression problems. I'm making a focus on hyperparameter tuning by using techniques like Zooming In and Bayesian Optimization!!
